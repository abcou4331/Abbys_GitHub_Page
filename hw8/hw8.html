    <h2>This map shows the public water supply sources (the red dots) that are located within 15 miles of the Cape Fear River. I got the idea for this map after
        watching a documentary about the toxic PFAS in the Cape Fear River, which often ends up leaking into local water supplies. PFAS is a forever chemical that
        can be spread for many miles from its origin. I wanted to see how many water sources could be in danger of having PFAS in them based on how close to the river they are.
