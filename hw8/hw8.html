    <h3>This map shows the public water supply sources (the red dots) that are located within 15 miles of the Cape Fear River. I got the idea for this map after
        watching a documentary about the toxic PFAS in the Cape Fear River, which often ends up leaking into local water supplies. PFAS is a forever chemical that
        can be spread for many miles from its origin. I wanted to see how many water sources could be in danger of having PFAS in them based on how close to the river they are.
    </h3>
    <h3>I made this map by first downloading a dataset of NC Counties and uploading it into QGIS. Then I georeferenced an image from the internet that displayed the Haw River flowing into the Cape Fear River
        After georeferencing it, I traced the river and made a new line layer. After that, I deleted the georeferenced image to display just the one river. I then uploaded the water source data and put a 15 mile buffer on 
        the river and intersected the point layer over it using the Geoprocessing tools.
